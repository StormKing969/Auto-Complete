The purpose of this assignment is to write a program to implement autocomplete for a given set of N strings and nonnegative
weights. That is, given a prefix, find all strings in the set that start with the prefix, in descending order of weight.
Autocomplete is an important feature of many modern applications. As the user types, the program predicts the complete
query (typically a word or phrase) that the user intends to type. Autocomplete is most effective when there are a limited
number of likely queries.
